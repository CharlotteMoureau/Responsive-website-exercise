# Responsive-website-exercise

This was a solo project carried out on the 19th of January 2021 as part of the BeCode Li√®ge's Junior Web Developer programm. We were tasked to make a responsive web design using media queries.

## Learning objectives

- [ ] Learn how to use media queries
- [ ] Perform a few exercices to achieve that goal

## The instructions were:

1. Change the colour

Create a HTML file and a CSS file. Make it so the background color of Body is red when the width of the viewport is smaller than 410px, green when the viewport width is bigger than 410px and smaller than 768px, and blue when the viewport is bigger than 768px.
2. Display / hide elements

Add three ```div:``` one div with the ```id="small"```, one div with the ```id="medium"```, another div with the ```id="large"```. In each element add the word small, medium and large to its content for display purposes.

Make it so only one DIV is displayed, according to the width of the current viewport.
3. Adapt the size of the text according to the device

In each DIV, add a title and a few paragraphs (lorem ipsum, and such). Give the title a descriptive text (for example: "Content for smartphones") Change the font size according to the device type.
4. Re-Arrange

Make it so that :

- if small, the 3 divs are stacked on top of one and other.
- if medium, the first div takes 2/3 of width, the second 1/3 of width and the third the full width.
- if big, the 3 divs should be next to one and other.
